    <h3 id="Fire on the montain">Fire on the montain</h3>
    <pre>
    Mmm
    Worry, oh, oh
    Mmm-mm
    There is fire on the mountain
    And nobody seems to be on the run
    Oh, there is fire on the mountaintop
    And no one is a-runnin'
    I wake up in the mornin'
    Tell you what I see on my TV screen
    I see the blood of an innocent child
    And everybody's watchin'
    Now I'm looking out my window
    And what do I see?
    I see an army of a soldier man
    Marching across the street, yeah
    Hey, Mr. Soldier man
    Tomorrow is the day you go to war
    But you are fighting for another man's cause
    And you don't even know him
    Oooh!
    What did he say to make you so blind
    To your conscience and reason?
    Could it be love for your country?
    Or for the gun you use in killing?
    So... there is fire on the mountain
    And nobody seems to be on the run
    Oh, there is fire on the mountaintop
    And no one…     
    </pre>

    Mmm
    No, no, no, no
    Oh yeah
    I'm in chains, you're in chains too
    I wear uniforms and you wear uniforms too
    I'm a prisoner
    You're a prisoner too, Mr. Jailer
    Oh
    I have fears, you have fears too
    I will die, but yourself will die too
    Life is beautiful
    Don't you think so too, Mr. Jailer?
    I'm talking to you jailer!
    Stop calling me a prisoner
    Let he who is without sin be the first to cast the stone
    Mr. Jailer
    Mr. Jailer man
    You suppress all my strategies
    You oppress whoa whoa every part of me
    What you don't know
    You're a victim too, Mr. Jailer
    Oh!
    You don't care about my point of view
    If I die another will work for you
    So you treat me like a modern slave, Mr. Jailer
    I'm talking to you jailer!
    Stop calling me a prisoner
    Let he who is without sin be the first to cast the stone…
