    <h2>History</h2>
    <h2>1921â€“1940</h2>
    <p>
      In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of
      Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, with the name
      of the resulting company a portmanteau of the name of both companies.[10]
      In the 1930s, business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and
      Latin America. During this time, Unilever acquired the United Africa
      Company, created from a merger of the African & Eastern Trade Corporation
      and the Royal Niger Company, which oversaw British trade interests in
      present-day Nigeria during the colonial era.[11] The Nazi occupation of
      Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to
      reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in
      the UK and the US.[12] In 1943, it acquired T. J. Lipton, a majority stake
      in Frosted Foods (owner of the Birds Eye brand) and Batchelors Peas, one
      of the largest vegetables canners in the UK.[13][14] In 1944, Pepsodent
      was acquired.[14]
